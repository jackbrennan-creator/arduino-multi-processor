To use this software, called dataflow, download the library folder as a ZIP file and add it to your libraries in the Arduino IDE.

You will need to build the hardware before you can use the library!

The hardware described on the website provides symmetrical inter-processor communication via an 8-bit wide parallel bus and allows simultaneous upload of programs to all 16 processors at the same time from the Arduino IDE. The library available here provides the communication and upload framework for writing multi-programs in the Arduino C++ language.
